Eva knows that she will often have to work with more than one service at once. She wants to practice creating two separate clients for two different services in boto3.
One service is s3 (for storage) and one is sns (simple notification service). So Eva needs to initialize a boto3 client for s3 and another client for sns. 
Her AWS key id and AWS secret have been stored in AWS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET respectively. Below are the sample codes:
## Generate the boto3 client for interacting with s3 and sns:
s3=boto3.client('s3', region_name='us-east-1', 
                      aws_access_key_id=AWS_KEY_ID, 
                      aws_secret_access_key=AWS_SECRET)

sns=boto3.client('sns', region_name='us-east-1',
                      aws_access_key_id=AWS_KEY_ID,
                      aws_secret_access_key=AWS_SECRET)

## List s3 buckets and sns topics
buckets=s3.list_buckets()
topics=sns.list_topics()

## Print out the list of SNS topics
print(topics)
